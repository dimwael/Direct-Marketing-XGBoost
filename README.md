# Direct-Marketing-XGBoost

Direct marketing, either through mail, email, phone, etc., is a common tactic to acquire customers. Because resources and a customer's attention is limited, the goal is to only target the subset of prospects who are likely to engage with a specific offer. Predicting those potential customers based on readily available information like demographics, past interactions, and environmental factors is a common machine learning problem.

This notebook presents an example problem to predict if a customer will enroll for a term deposit at a bank, after one or more phone calls. The steps include:

    Preparing your Jupyter notebook
    Downloading data from the internet 
    Investigating and transforming the data so that it can be fed to XGBoost algorithms
    Estimating a model using the Gradient Boosting algorithm
    Evaluating the effectiveness of the model
    Setting the model up to make on-going predictions
